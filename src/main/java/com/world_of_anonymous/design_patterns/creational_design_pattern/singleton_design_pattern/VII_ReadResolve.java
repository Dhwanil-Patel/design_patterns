/**
 * Letâ€™s say your application is distributed and it frequently serializes objects into the file system,

 *
 * Initial call define in main class display two values means more then one object exist.
 * To solve above issue, we need to include a readResolve() method in our class. This method will be invoked when you will de-serialize the object.
 * Inside of this method, you must return the existing instance to ensure a single instance application wide.
