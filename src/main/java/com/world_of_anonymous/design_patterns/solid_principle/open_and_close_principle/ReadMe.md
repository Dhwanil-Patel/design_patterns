Open / Close Principle

- Open for extension close for modification
- Which means that, Your actual logic have to be same don't allow to change, But allow
  Other class to extend them and modify it as per they need.
- E.g. iPhone or Android give video call feature. Other app use them and provide feature of face change option.
  In this case provider allow to access camera to perform such kind of operation but don't allow to modify the feature given by company.
- If your client requirement is change and add varity of thing in same logical function, In such case saprate them in two part.
  One contain fixed code and another classes use second portion. So you just have to extend and integrate.
